          <h2>Sustainable Computing</h2>
              <p>Sustainable computing is the basis of how the computing world is continually evolving to try and adjust to the ever changing world we live in. It is there to try and allow us to create everything we may require in terms of computing whilst doing so in a safe way not only for us but also for the planet we live on. Sustainable computing by definition is “a life-cycle management approach to the deployment of IT across an organization” “that embraces a range of policies, procedures, programs, and attitudes that run the length and breadth of any use of information technologies”[Cornell University]. In this paper I intend to focus on one particular section of sustainable computing and that is green computing. Green computing is “the environmentally responsible and eco-friendly use of computers and their resources”[Techopedia] and therefore covers everything from the manufacture of computer systems all the way through their lifecycle from before the products were created, through the time they are being used and finally to the point where they need to be disposed of in some form or another.</p>

              <p>Green computing as I already mentioned is important from the outset of the creation of any piece of computing equipment with companies trying to minimise their carbon footprint on the world throughout the manufacturing progress as well as taking factors into account from the planning stage. The majority of computers use most of their energy throughout their lifecycle just in being produced and created with 81% being used in production as opposed to 19% of its overall energy output through its operational lifetime[Williams, 2004]. Companies are doing a lot to try and combat this by doing things such as creating green business plans and supply chains[Benita M. Beamon, (1999)] in order to effectively minimise their carbon footprints. Changing and adapting to a green supply chain or business plan allows companies to “investigate”[Benita M. Beamon, (1999)] and evaluate their current business plans and look at the “challenges presented” by a green supply chain and how they can achieve a more economical and environmentally friendly way of running their business[Benita M. Beamon, (1999)]. By doing this companies can change in a way that affects “raw material acquisition to final product delivery”[Benita M. Beamon, (1999)]  which in turn reduces pressure on the Earth’s natural resources and also reduces pollution of the planet’s natural ecosystems both of which can be devastating not just for wildlife but also other human beings.</p>

              <p>Another way companies are trying to adapt to green computing is by making sure that the computers or equipment they use are fulfilling their maximum amount of possible life whilst also not just throwing any equipment away when they are done with it. Companies are doing this by recycling and upgrading parts[Vimal, P Parmer. Apurva, K Pandya. Kumbharana, CK. (2015)] that they can use.This allows for less wastage over a longer period of time therefore extending the hardware’s life and the overall usefulness of the products and their components.
              If these computers and products cannot be reused then people “must dispose of them properly in environmentally friendly ways”[Murugesan, S]. This is not an easy task as most computer parts end up in landfills which equates to “20 to 50 million tons of e-waste”[Murugesan, S] being piled up every year. Another problem with this is the fact that many computer components contain many “toxic materials such as lead, chromium, cadmium and mercury”[Murugesan, S] which when burned release gases harmful to humans and the environment. This is why companies set standards for which they must follow to stop anything like this from happening and to once again help them minimise their carbon footprint and overall effect on the world and the people that inhabit it.</p>

              <p>Green computing is not only about the manufacture and dismissal of computing components and equipment but it can also relate to what happens during it’s use and especially when it comes to the things that consumers use and buy on a daily basis. A lot is done by companies to make sure that their products are as energy efficient as possible when in use by trying to use only as much energy as they require and optimising the use of the heat energy they receive[Vimal, P Parmer. Apurva, K Pandya. Kumbharana, CK. (2015)]. There are also many ideas about using the energy that would usually be wasted to try and create other types of useable energy in the system to help “increase the life cycle of devices”[Vimal, P Parmer. Apurva, K Pandya. Kumbharana, CK. (2015)]. This would mean that it would save the consumer money by reducing the cost of running the machine due to the increased power efficiency[Vimal, P Parmer. Apurva, K Pandya. Kumbharana, CK. (2015)] although the system would have to be properly maintained to do so.</p>

              <p>In conclusion it is quite simple to see that green computing is making an impact on the world of technology in an extremely significant way. It is in everything we do whether it be at home or in our offices and it is a part of any technology from the outset and even the design period. It helps to determine whether a product could be economically viable to create in terms of the energy it would take to produce whilst it also helps to do decide how we will then dispose of, or recycle, all of our equipment within and around our lives. Green computing allows us as a species to not only work and develop technology in a better, more efficient, way but as well as this also allows us to protect the planet we live in on on a mass scale.</p>
